# CC-Keyboard Firmware

RP2040 based keyboard firmware written in rust. The CC-Keyboard is my custom designed otherlinear 12 column, 4 row keyboard.

## Current Features
- Basic HID keyboard functionality
- Customizable keymaps

## Future plans
- Custom keymap layers
- Better sleep handling (currently dies when computer goes to sleep)
- Windows support (Testing on MacOS but when used on windows it did not seem to work)
- Macros
